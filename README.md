# Verdex

Verdex is a tool to generate sustainable itineraries for trips to Singapore and to share your sustainable itinerary and experiences with others in a community excited about sustainable tourism.

Verdex is an ambitious project envisioned and developed by the Verdex Team for the App Development Project module in Year 1 Semester 2 of the Diploma in Information Technology course at Nanyang Polytechnic.

The app has a 50% chance of being live at [verdex.app](https://verdex.app). Try your luck.
